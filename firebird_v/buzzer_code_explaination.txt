buzzer code explaion

This is a simple program for an AVR microcontroller that turns a buzzer on and off at regular intervals. The `pin_config` function sets the PC3 pin (pin 3 on PORTC) as an output for the buzzer. The `buzzer_on` function sets the PC3 pin high to turn on the buzzer, and the `buzzer_off` function sets the PC3 pin low to turn off the buzzer. In the `main` function, the buzzer is turned on for 1 second (`_delay_ms(1000)`) and then turned off for 1 second repeatedly in an infinite loop.


```c
#define F_CPU 14745600
```
This line defines the CPU frequency as 14.7456 MHz, which is necessary for the delay functions to work correctly.

```c
#include <avr/io.h>
#include <avr/interrupt.h>
#include <util/delay.h>
```
These lines include necessary header files for AVR programming. `<avr/io.h>` for I/O register definitions, `<avr/interrupt.h>` for interrupt handling, and `<util/delay.h>` for creating delays.

```c
void pin_config(void){
    DDRC=0X08;
    PORTC=0X00;
}
```
This function `pin_config` configures the pins. It sets the PC3 pin (pin 3 on PORTC) as an output for the buzzer (`DDRC=0X08;`) and sets the initial state of PORTC to 0, which turns the buzzer off (`PORTC=0X00;`).

```c
void buzzer_on(void){
    PORTC=0X08;
}
```
This function `buzzer_on` turns the buzzer on by setting PC3 (pin 3 on PORTC) high (`PORTC=0X08;`).

```c
void buzzer_of(void){
    PORTC=0X00;
}
```
This function `buzzer_off` turns the buzzer off by setting PC3 (pin 3 on PORTC) low (`PORTC=0X00;`).

```c
int main(void){
    pin_config();
    
    while(1){
        buzzer_on();
        _delay_ms(1000);
        buzzer_off();
        _delay_ms(1000); 
    }
}
```
The `main` function calls `pin_config` to initialize the pins. Then, it enters an infinite loop (`while(1)`) where it repeatedly turns the buzzer on for 1 second (`_delay_ms(1000);`), and then off for 1 second (`_delay_ms(1000);`), creating a 1-second beep followed by a 1-second pause.
